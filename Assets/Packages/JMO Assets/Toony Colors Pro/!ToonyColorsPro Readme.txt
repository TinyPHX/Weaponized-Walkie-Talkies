=============================

USAGE
-----
Select one of the following shader in your Material:
- Toony Colors Pro 2/Desktop

Then select the features you want to enable (bump, specular, rim...), and the correct shader will automatically
be selected for you.
Use the (?) buttons to see help for specific features, or read the documentation for more information.

UPDATE NOTES
------------
2.2.51
- Unity 5.5 compatibility
- added "HSV Controls" feature (hue/saturation/value)
- updated masks with new template system

2.2.5
- added "Diffuse Tint" option in Shader Generator
- added "Separated Ramp" option in Shader Generator
- added "Vertex Colors" option for all Masks
- major update to the Shader Generator:
 -> now the whole UI is embedded into the templates (will make it easier to create different templates)
 -> uses a more robust condition parser
 -> the old template is still available, with the old behavior, in case the new system doesn't properly work
- fixed compilation issue on PBS shaders when UNITY_STANDARD_SIMPLE was used (it is now ignored)
- bug fixes in Terrain template

2.2.45
- added "Normal Map Blending" option for "Vertex Texture Blending" feature
- updated the "Sketch" effects in the Shader Generator:
 -> the screen-space texture will be offset based on the object's position, removing the 'shower door' artefact
 -> go back to the old behavior by enabling the 'Disable Obj-Space Offset' option
 -> removed 'Scale with Model' option, now integrated with the new object-space offset
 -> the UVs aren't multiplied with the resolution anymore, giving consistent texture scale across resolutions
- updated "Subsurface Scattering" in the Shader Generator:
 -> separated Ambient Color and Color
 -> additive mode is now the default behavior for more consistency, use "Multiplicative" option for previous behavior
 -> fixed shadows affecting subsurface with directional lights

2.2.44
- fixed corrupted packed shaders (Unity 5.4)

2.2.43
- fixed "Use Reflection Probes" option in Desktop shader (Unity 5.4)

2.2.42
- allow Emission Color to be enabled without Emission Map in Shader Generator
- added "HDR Color" option for Emission Color in Shader Generator (useful for effects like bloom)
- renamed internal variable _IllumColor to _EmissionColor in templates
- dropped support for Unity 5.0.0 and lower (older versions still available to download)

2.2.41
- updated PBS shaders to match Standard shaders in Unity 5.4
- added "Dithered Shadows" option in Shader Generator for alpha-blended shaders
- fixed initial blending values for Alpha Blending option in Shader Generator
- minor fix to Shader Generator templates

2.2.4
- added "Subsurface Scattering" option in Shader Generator
- fixed inspectors issue with Mac retina displays

2.2.31
- added "Bump Scale" option in Shader Generator
- fixed issues when updating shaders with custom output path enabled
- removed Unity5.4 templates and added differences in the main Unity5 template

2.2.3
- added Ramp Generator utility
- added option to explicitly set shader model target in Shader Generator
- added Shader Generator template for Terrain shaders (experimental)
- removed explicit "#pragma target 2.0" in PBS shaders for lower LOD, allowing it to default to shader model target 2.5 in Unity 5.4
- renamed "Self-Illumination" feature to "Emission" in Shader Generator
- custom output path fix for already existing shaders

2.2.2
- added option to save generated shaders in custom directory

2.2.1
- added Unity 5.4 compatible templates for the Shader Generator (fix for reflection probes sampling)
- fixed seamless tiling on some sketch textures

2.2
- added "Standard PBS" version of the shaders, based on Unity Standard shaders (Unity 5.3+ only)
- added "TCP2 Demo PBS" scene to show the PBS shaders
- moved "Outline Only" shaders to their own category
- updated documentation

2.14.1

2.14
- added "Light-based Mask" option for Rim Lighting in Shader Generator

2.13
- added option to disable wrapped diffuse lighting
- added "Colors Multipliers" option to Shader Generator
- bug fixes and improvements

2.12.2
- disabled custom lightmapping support in Unity5+, turns out it doesn't work anymore with surface shaders

- removed double lighting multiplication in Unity 5 template for Shader Generator
- Smoothed Normal Utility now copies blend shape data in Unity 5.3+

2.12
- added support for "Curved World" by Davit Naskidashvili in the Shader Generator (requires the "Curved World" package from the Asset Store)
- refactored outline shaders code with TCP2_Outline_Include.cginc
- fixed Blended Outline Only shaders queue (from opaque to transparent)
- fixed Outline Only material inspector glitch with slider properties in Unity 5+

2.11.2
