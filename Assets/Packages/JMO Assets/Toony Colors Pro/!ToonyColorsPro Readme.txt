=============================

USAGE
-----
Select one of the following shader in your Material:
- Toony Colors Pro 2/Desktop

UPDATE NOTES
------------
2.2.51
- Unity 5.5 compatibility
- added "HSV Controls" feature (hue/saturation/value)
- updated masks with new template system

2.2.5
- added "Diffuse Tint" option in Shader Generator
- added "Separated Ramp" option in Shader Generator
- added "Vertex Colors" option for all Masks
- major update to the Shader Generator:
 -> now the whole UI is embedded into the templates (will make it easier to create different templates)
 -> uses a more robust condition parser
 -> the old template is still available, with the old behavior, in case the new system doesn't properly work
- fixed compilation issue on PBS shaders when UNITY_STANDARD_SIMPLE was used (it is now ignored)
- bug fixes in Terrain template

2.2.45
- added "Normal Map Blending" option for "Vertex Texture Blending" feature
- updated the "Sketch" effects in the Shader Generator:
 -> the screen-space texture will be offset based on the object's position, removing the 'shower door' artefact
 -> go back to the old behavior by enabling the 'Disable Obj-Space Offset' option
 -> removed 'Scale with Model' option, now integrated with the new object-space offset
 -> the UVs aren't multiplied with the resolution anymore, giving consistent texture scale across resolutions
- updated "Subsurface Scattering" in the Shader Generator:
 -> separated Ambient Color and Color
 -> additive mode is now the default behavior for more consistency, use "Multiplicative" option for previous behavior
 -> fixed shadows affecting subsurface with directional lights

2.2.44
- fixed corrupted packed shaders (Unity 5.4)

2.2.43
- fixed "Use Reflection Probes" option in Desktop shader (Unity 5.4)

2.2.42
- allow Emission Color to be enabled without Emission Map in Shader Generator
- added "HDR Color" option for Emission Color in Shader Generator (useful for effects like bloom)
- renamed internal variable _IllumColor to _EmissionColor in templates
- dropped support for Unity 5.0.0 and lower (older versions still available to download)

2.2.41
- updated PBS shaders to match Standard shaders in Unity 5.4
- added "Dithered Shadows" option in Shader Generator for alpha-blended shaders
- fixed initial blending values for Alpha Blending option in Shader Generator
- minor fix to Shader Generator templates

2.2.4
- added "Subsurface Scattering" option in Shader Generator
- fixed inspectors issue with Mac retina displays

2.2.31
- added "Bump Scale" option in Shader Generator
- fixed issues when updating shaders with custom output path enabled
- removed Unity5.4 templates and added differences in the main Unity5 template

2.2.3
- added Ramp Generator utility
- added option to explicitly set shader model target in Shader Generator
- added Shader Generator template for Terrain shaders (experimental)
- removed explicit "#pragma target 2.0" in PBS shaders for lower LOD, allowing it to default to shader model target 2.5 in Unity 5.4
- renamed "Self-Illumination" feature to "Emission" in Shader Generator
- custom output path fix for already existing shaders

2.2.2
- added option to save generated shaders in custom directory

2.2.1
- added Unity 5.4 compatible templates for the Shader Generator (fix for reflection probes sampling)
- fixed seamless tiling on some sketch textures

2.2
- added "Standard PBS" version of the shaders, based on Unity Standard shaders (Unity 5.3+ only)
- added "TCP2 Demo PBS" scene to show the PBS shaders
- moved "Outline Only" shaders to their own category
- updated documentation

2.14.1

2.14
- added "Light-based Mask" option for Rim Lighting in Shader Generator

2.13
- added option to disable wrapped diffuse lighting
- added "Colors Multipliers" option to Shader Generator
- bug fixes and improvements

2.12.2
- disabled custom lightmapping support in Unity5+, turns out it doesn't work anymore with surface shaders

- removed double lighting multiplication in Unity 5 template for Shader Generator
- Smoothed Normal Utility now copies blend shape data in Unity 5.3+

2.12
- added support for "Curved World" by Davit Naskidashvili in the Shader Generator (requires the "Curved World" package from the Asset Store)
- refactored outline shaders code with TCP2_Outline_Include.cginc
- fixed Blended Outline Only shaders queue (from opaque to transparent)
- fixed Outline Only material inspector glitch with slider properties in Unity 5+

2.11.2
